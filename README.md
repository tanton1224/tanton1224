Learning more about Java and exploring the possibilities it offers for future projects

## My Skills

Python (Flask)
TailwindCSS
Java (currently learning!)

## What I Love
Science fiction and fantasy - I'm a huge fan of all things in these genres, and I love incorporating them into my work whenever possible.
Creating things - Whether it's building a new app or crafting a unique piece of art, I love the feeling of bringing something new into the world.
