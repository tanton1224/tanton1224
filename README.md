# Hello! I'm Thomas Anton!
A little about me: I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating exciting new features for users. I work with JavaScript and Python mostly, utilizing React/Redux and Flask for most projects. I'm also teaching myself C#!
I'm an avid fan of all things science fiction and fantasy and I love to create things in that genre.
